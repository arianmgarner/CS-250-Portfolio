# CS-250-Portfolio
Sprint Review and Retrospective



# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
In Scum/Agile, the Product Owner and Scrum Master have the initial meetings with the client to get to know the client and their needs. After this, it is decided what to add to the Product Backlog amd what user stories need to be priotitized over the others. When the user stories are created, we are able to begin working on our code for the client. By using user stories we are able to keep the coding language and human language gap bridged. I allows the client and the team to understand the objective. Another benefit is the ability to organize the Product Backlog, priotize the user stories, and meet goals during Sprints.


# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Approaching a project depends on the size of the project, the time frame given by the client and the demand of the client itself. After learning about Scrum and Agile during this course, I believe that the Agile method is an adaptable and successful method of approach. I hope to incorporate efficient team communication, attend the Scrum events, and be able to learn what my own definition of "done" is.


# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software devekopment, I need to be able to communicate efficiently, have self awareness/the ability to self reflect, and meet my goals. There are a lot of items that add up to being aspects of a good team member. It is important to remember to have down time with your team, not only to grow closer, but to refresh your ming for work again. A good team member shows up to all of the Scrum events and is not late to them.
